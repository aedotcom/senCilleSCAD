# senCilleSCAD
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for OpenSCAD. 

The current version has the basic functionalities. 
You can edit the source code with many common functions like copy and paste, undo/redo, save as, etc.

The most input in this first version is that you can edit the source code and without doing anything the drawing is taking place in the OpenSCAD window. 

Another interesting input is that you can export the file to some formats, like PNG, STL or DXF.

The next desirable things to add the application are the options of export the files previous modifications of something like the camera position, image size, or colour scheme.

This part is not accomplished yet because in the current version of OpenSCAD these parameters are not working for Windows version.

Another thing we want for the application in next version is a compilation for Mac OS X and another for Linux.
